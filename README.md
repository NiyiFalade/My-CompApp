## Introduction 

The Test Automation Framework was done using Serenity Screenplay, a powerful test automation framework designed to write high-quality automated tests using the screenplay pattern. It enables teams to create maintainable, readable, and scalable automated tests for web applications using Java and Selenium WebDriver.

## Features 
- **Screenplay Pattern
- **Serenity Reporting
- **Page Object Model
- **Data-Driven Testing
- ** Integration With Selenium WebDriver

## Getting Started
To get started with the Serenity Screenplay framework, follow these steps:

- 1 - Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.
- 2 - Set Up Your Environment: Ensure you have Java and Maven installed on your machine.
- 3-  Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using Maven.
- 4- Run Your Tests  - mvn clean verify

## Solution

- Compare the data returned from the Website against the output file
- Generate a report 

## Issues 
 - Carzoo Enter my reg failed to return valid car details for some of the number plates

##  Future Improvements
 - More tests validation
 - Improve on data extraction process
 - Extend the portabilty of the framework
 - Enable test framework to run a CI/CD Pipeline
